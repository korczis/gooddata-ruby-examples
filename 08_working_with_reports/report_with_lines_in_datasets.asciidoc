=== You would like to create a report which counts lines of all the datasets
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
As stated in another recipe, creating a report that counts lines in a dataset is a tedious and difficult task in UI. Why not automate it?

==== Solution

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  project = c.projects('project_id')

  bp = project.blueprint
  anchors = bp.datasets.map {|d| [d, d.anchor]}
  ids = anchors.map do |d, a|
    a.nil? ? GoodData::Model.identifier_for(d.to_hash, type: :anchor_no_label) : GoodData::Model.identifier_for(d.to_hash, a)
  end
  attributes = ids.pmap {|id| project.attributes(id)}

  puts project.compute_report(left: attributes.map(&:create_metric))
end

==== Discussion

Currently the API is not ideal and the recipe depdends on user not messing with identifiers of anchors (connection_points) in case they are without labels.
