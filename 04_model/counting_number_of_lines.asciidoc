=== Computing number of lines in a dataset
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
Very often there is a need to know how many lines there are in a dataset.

==== Solution
This is not so easy to do on UI. You basically have to find the main attribute on a dataset and then create a report. It is much easier to use SDK for a shortcut.

[source,ruby]

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  project = GoodData.use('project_id')
  blueprint = project.blueprint
  count = blueprint.datasets.first.count(project)
  puts "Number of lines in a dataset is #{count}"
end
