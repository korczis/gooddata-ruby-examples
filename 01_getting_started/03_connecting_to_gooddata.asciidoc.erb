=== Connecting to gooddata
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You know how to jack in and how to write a simple program. Now it is time to combine these two to write a program that connects and does something with a gooddata project.

==== Solution

<%= render_ruby 'src/01_getting_started/03_connecting_to_gooddata.rb' %>


==== Discussion

Maybe you are wondering if there are other ways how to log in. First of all it is not nice to have secret credentials in plain text like this. SDK has one feature to help you. If `GoodData.with_connection` or `GoodData.connect` is called without any params it tries to find the param file that contains these credentials. Currently it looks ~/.gooddata and it expects the file to have content like this

[source,json]
----
{
  "username": "john@example.com",
  "password": "pass",
  "auth_token": "token"
}
----

You do not have to create it yourself. Run `gooddata auth store` for small wizard to help you. This way (see recipe X)

Also it is possible to pass parameters as hash. The form that we have shown is just a convenience form.

GoodData.with_connection(user: 'user', login: 'password')
