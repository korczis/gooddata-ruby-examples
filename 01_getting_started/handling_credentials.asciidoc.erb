=== Handling credentials when you log in to gooddata
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to write scripts that are sharable. Currently you either have to rely on ~/.gooddata file or put there the credentials by hand. This is error prone and you have to be careful so you do not share your passwords.

==== Solution
There is fairly easy solution that you can use. If you recall correctly there is a way how you can log in into platform.

[source,ruby]
----
GoodData.connect(login: 'user', password: 'password')
----

This takes several types of parameters one of which is a hash of values. You can leverage that and read the hash from a file. There a many variants we are going to show 2 most popular ones, YAML and JSON.

===== JSON

Create a file that looks like this.

[source,json]
----
{
  "login" : "john@gooddata.com",
  "password" : "my_secret"
}
----

[source,ruby]
----
params = JSON.parse(File.read('/path/to/file))
client = GoodData.connect(params)
puts client.projects.count
----

===== YAML

Create a file that looks like this.

[source,yaml]
----
login: john@gooddata.com
password: my_secret
----

[source,ruby]
----
require 'yaml'

params = YAML.load(File.read('/path/to/file))
client = GoodData.connect(params)
puts client.projects.count
----

==== Discussion

You see that you can easily share these scripts with other people since you have externalized all sensitive information. If the user will put the config file on a expected place everything will just work. There are other formats and ways you can leverage but the idea is always the same.

This is actually something we do behind the scenes if you do not specify any params into connect or with_connection. We look at ~/.gooddata for a JSON file and use what we find there. This is extremely useful when you are showing things interactively so you do not have to disclose your credentials. You can either go and create the file by hand or you can use a convenience method we have created for you. Just call gooddata auth store and you will be asked couple of questions and the file will be created for you.
