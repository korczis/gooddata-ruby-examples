=== Connecting to different server
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
Sometimes the server you would like to connect is not the secure.goodata.com machine. This might occur for 2 reasons. Either you are trying something on a test machine (if you are working for gooddata) or you are working with a project that is on a white labeled instance.

==== Solution
Solution to both is passing the server name as a pareameter to connect or with_connection functions.
