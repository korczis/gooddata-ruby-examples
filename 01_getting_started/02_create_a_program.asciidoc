=== Creating a program that you can run in a non-interactive fashion
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You created a program by building it up in an interactive manner but now you would like to put it into a file to be able to run it

==== Solution

gooddata -p project_pid -U john.doe@example.com -P secret project jack-in

==== Discussion
You should be in an interactive session where you can evaluate your ideas and verify that everything works in an fast fashion before you put your program in a file that is much more useful for a batch oriented execution
