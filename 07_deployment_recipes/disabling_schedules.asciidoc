=== Disabling schedules in all your projects
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to disable all schedules on all processes on all the projects you have access to and have sufficient privileges to do so

==== Solution

[source,ruby]
----
require 'gooddata'
require 'pmap'

client = GoodData.connect
GoodData.with_connection do |client|
  schedules = client.projects.pselect(&:am_i_admin?).pmapcat(&:schedules)
  schedules.pmap do |schedule|
    schedule.disable
    schedule.save
  end
end
