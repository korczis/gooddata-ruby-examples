by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to create an exact copy of a project

==== Solution
You can use cloning capabilities.

[source,ruby]

# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection('user', 'password') do |c|
  project = GoodData.use('project_pid')
  cloned_project = project.clone(title: 'New title', auth_token: 'token')
end
----

==== Discussion
There are two options that you can specify. You can pick if you want to clone just structures or also data. Default is with data. Also you can pick if you want to transfer all users to the new project. Default is no users. Only you will be in the new project.
